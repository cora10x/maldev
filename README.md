# Shellcode Injection Explanation

## Overview

This repository aims to provide information and examples related to shellcode injection. Shellcode injection is a technique where malicious code (shellcode) is injected into a running process to gain control or manipulate its behavior.

## What is Shellcode?

Shellcode is typically a small piece of machine code that is designed to be executed by a compromised process. It is often written in assembly language and aims to perform specific actions, such as spawning a shell or establishing a backdoor connection.

## How Shellcode Injection Works

Shellcode injection involves injecting this malicious code into the memory space of a target process. This can be achieved through various means, such as buffer overflows, code injection, or other vulnerabilities in the target application.
